# Face-Detection
Face Detection and Tracking using LabelMe, TensorFlow, and OpenCV

---

Overview:

This repository contains code for implementing a face detection and tracking system using the LabelMe dataset, TensorFlow, and OpenCV. The system is designed to detect faces in real-time video feeds and track their movements. Below is a brief overview of the contents and functionality of each file:

1. `face_detection_tracking.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook file contains the main code for collecting images, preprocessing the data, building and training the face detection and tracking model, and finally deploying the model to detect and track faces in real-time using a webcam.

2. `README.md`: This Markdown file (Readme) provides instructions on how to set up the environment, run the code, and understand the project structure.

Setup Instructions:

To set up the environment and run the code, follow these steps:

1. Install the required Python packages by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
   
   ```
   !pip install labelme tensorflow tensorflow-gpu opencv-python matplotlib albumentations
   ```

2. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

3. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   
   ```
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

4. Open and run the `face_detection_tracking.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

Project Structure:

- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset, including images and corresponding labels.
  
- `aug_data/`: After augmentation, this directory contains augmented images and their labels.
  
- `logs/`: This directory contains log files generated during model training for visualization using TensorBoard.

- `README.md`: This Markdown file provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and project structure.

- `face_detection_tracking.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains the main code for face detection and tracking.

Usage:

1. Open the `face_detection_tracking.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

2. Execute the cells sequentially to perform the following tasks:
   - Collect images using a webcam.
   - Preprocess the data and augment the dataset.
   - Build and train the face detection and tracking model.
   - Deploy the model to detect and track faces in real-time using a webcam.

Notes:

- Ensure that you have a webcam connected to your system for real-time face detection and tracking.
- Adjust the parameters and hyperparameters as needed for your specific use case and hardware configuration.
